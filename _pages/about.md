I am a final-year PhD student at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/). My research is co-advised by Prof. [Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com/) and Prof. [XiaoFeng Wang](https://wangxiaofeng7.github.io/). I earned my B.A. from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) and my M.S. from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research mainly focuses on data-driven security, especially cybercrime measurement and machine learning security. Presently, my exploration is centered on the security around the supply chain of Large Language Models.

Besides academic research, I'm also interested in violin and swimming. I am currently honing my skills in violin performance at the [Jacobs School of Music, Indiana University Bloomington](https://music.indiana.edu/).
