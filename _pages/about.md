I am a fifth-year PhD student at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/). My research is co-advised by Prof. [Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com/) and Prof. [XiaoFeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/). 
My research mainly focuses on system security, especially cybercrime and machine learning security. Presently, my exploration is centered on the security around Large Language Models (LLM).

Besides academic research, Iâ€™m also interested in violin and swimming. I am currently honing my skills in violin performance at the [Jacobs School of Music, Indiana University Bloomington](https://music.indiana.edu/).
