I am a final-year PhD student at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/). My research is co-advised by Prof. [Xiaojing Liao](https://www.xiaojingliao.com/) and Prof. [XiaoFeng Wang](https://wangxiaofeng7.github.io/). Also, I am an incoming tenure-track Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [University of Missouri - Kansas City](https://www.umkc.edu/), effective Fall 2025. 

My research mainly focuses on data-driven security, especially cyber threat intelligence and secure machine learning systems. Presently, my exploration is centered on the security around Large Language Models.

Besides academic research, I'm also interested in violin and swimming. I am currently honing my skills in violin performance at the [Jacobs School of Music, Indiana University Bloomington](https://music.indiana.edu/).

<span style="color:crimson"><strong>I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students to start in Spring or Fall 2026.</strong></span>
